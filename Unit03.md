**Unit 3: Spreadsheet Design and Implementation** <span id="3"></span> 
*The final unit of this course will build upon the concepts discussed in
the previous units. You will apply what you have learned by creating a
spreadsheet that can be used in a real world environment. The design of
the columns and rows allows you and those who view your spreadsheet to
quickly understand how the cells relate to one another. If you set up
your spreadsheet correctly, you will be able to make quick data
calculations. For example, you could quickly demonstrate the costs for
specific services or products to potential clients. Also, spreadsheet
functions can be used with home budgeting, grade averaging, quotes,
invoices, cost analysis, etc. Do not be afraid to experiment, as
spreadsheets can be instrumental to saving time in our business and
personal lives.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   recall the steps used in adding data to a cell;
-   identify the differences between a row and column in a sheet;
-   explain how to use Excel to multiply data in rows and add data in
    columns;
-   categorize different column and row data to have a reasonable
    structure; and
-   identify several ways to make a spreadsheet have the look and feel
    that matches the purpose for which it will be used.

**3.1 The Purpose of Spreadsheets** <span id="3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “The Purpose of Spreadsheets”**
    Link: Study the example spreadsheets linked below.  
      
     Instructions: There are unlimited ways to use a spreadsheet.
    Typical uses include household budgets, sales reports, inventories,
    and other reports. The power of Excel is that the user totally
    controls the function of the spreadsheet, as well as the look and
    feel of the end product.  
      
     As you learn to manipulate cells and build the basic sheet, the
    purpose of why you are building it ought to guide every detail of
    your creation. Excel has the power to allow you to control almost
    anything you desire to accomplish your purpose.  
      
     A straightforward and plain sheet would look like the example
    linked
    [here](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRDV004-3.1-A.png)
    (PNG).  
      
     Some people may prefer to add emphasis, as in this
    [example](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRDV004-3.2-B.png)
    (PNG).  
      
     Then, of course, some may go to the extreme, as in
    this [example](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRDV004-3.2-C.png)
    (PNG).  
      
     Studying these examples should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch this video on how to work with formulas and
    functions in Excel.

**3.3 Organization Is Key** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*If you create a spreadsheet without a clear purpose or you do not plan
its organization, the end product will be useless or confusing. You need
to draft the concept in your mind and perhaps on scratch paper before
you start building the sheet. It is a good idea to make a simple sketch
before you begin. This will help you determine how many rows and columns
you will need as well as what headings ought to be included.*  
  
 *When you work in Excel, your organization skills will begin to show.
After you develop the basic structure, you can add headings, data
(numbers or text), and formulas.*

     Instructions: Read this tutorial, keeping in mind the purpose of a
    spreadsheet. Go back and read page two with an idea of a spreadsheet
    you would like to make. Then, create your own spreadsheet in Excel,
    using the sketch you created as a guide. There is almost limitless
    power with examining numbers using Excel. Think of all the
    possibilities and try to use Excel spreadsheets in your business and
    family budgeting.  
      
     Reading this tutorial and working on these exercises should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
